- SQL2023 feature: Introduce UNIQUE NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT syntax which
  allows for NULLS to be treated as unique, i.e. a column with this
  contraint can have one NULL value at most.

- SQL2023 feature: Allow project and ORDER BY expressions on
  UNIQUE constrained columns when the primary key column is
  used in a GROUP BY expression.
