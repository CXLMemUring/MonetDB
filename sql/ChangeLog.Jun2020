# ChangeLog file for sql
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Mon May  9 2022 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Print current query when using CALL
  logging.setcomplevel('SQL_EXECUTION', 'INFO');
- Comments inside queries are now available in the sys.queue
  function/view.
- Fixed an issue where under heavy concurrent workloads, data could be
  lost in a sequence of truncate/delete all queries.
