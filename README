The MonetDB Database System

The MonetDB database is developed by the CWI database research group
(see https://www.monetdb.org/).

Via the MonetDB project we have brought the MonetDB system in open source,
where it is accessible at https://www.monetdb.org/Downloads/

The MonetDB database system is a high-performance database kernel for
query-intensive applications. The MonetDB source can be found at our mercurial server (https://dev.monetdb.org/hg/MonetDB/). There is also a github clone (https://github.com/MonetDB/MonetDB) that is updated once a day.

If you got a source distribution, please compile and install MonetDB first,
following the instructions in the "documentation" directory.
