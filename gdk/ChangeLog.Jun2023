- When saving the SQL catalog during a low-level commit, we should
  only save the part of the catalog that corresponds to the part of the
  write-ahead log that has been processed.  What we did was save more,
  which resulted in the catalog containing references to tables and
  columns whose disk presence is otherwise only in the write-ahead log.
