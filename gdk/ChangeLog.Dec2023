- Fixed a regression where bats weren't always cleaned up when they
  weren't needed anymore.  In particular, after a DELETE FROM table query
  without a WHERE clause (which deletes all rows from the table), the
  bats for the table get replaced by new ones, and the old, now unused,
  bats weren't removed from the database.
