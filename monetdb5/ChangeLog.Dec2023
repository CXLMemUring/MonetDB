# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5

- The mserver5 program has a new option: --without-geom.  If the server
  was compiled with geom support (or the geom module was installed in a
  binary distribution), this option allows the server to start without
  the geom module, so that it can proceed with a database that was
  created without geom.
