- Add support for select exp, count(*) group by 1 order by 1; ie. using
  numeric references Added support for group by all and order by all. The
  later is ordering on all columns of the selection.  The group by all
  finds all expressions from the selections which aren't aggregations
  and groups on those.  All can also be replaced by '*'.
