#TODO:
#=====
# - check all TODO's below
# - tidy -up HTML-generation by "keeping in mind" during testing,
#   which OUT/ERR differ or not and which tests were skipped.
#   dump HTML-stuff only at end
#   print an ascii summary at end, too
# - use sorting in .explain.functions_histogram
# - if no diffs, but warnings, say so at end
# - produce, keep & reference LOG
# - add a "grep-like" function and replace "inlined" grep
#   contains(<file>,<string>)
# - do multi-level prompting?
# - normalize all path's used
# - Python 3? (or do a full rewrite?)
