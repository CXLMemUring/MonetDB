# ChangeLog file for clients
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Wed Jan 10 2024 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Implemented interrupt handling in mclient.  When using mclient
  interactively, an interrupt (usually control-C) stops whatever the
  client is doing.  When editing a line, the line is discarded; when
  editing a second or later line of a query, the whole query is discarded;
  when a query is being executed, the server is asked to stop the query
  at its earliest convenience.  Stopping a running query can only be
  done with an up-to-date server.  All of this does not work on Windows.
