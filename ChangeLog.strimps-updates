- Implemented direct masking for strimp construction. The strimps
  datastructure now keeps an array of 65K 64-bit integers that is zero
  everywhere except at the indexes that correspond to header pairs. The
  entry for the nth pair in order has the nth bit of the bitstring
  on. These can be used to quickly construct bitstrings.
